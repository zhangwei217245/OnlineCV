abstract = {In this research, we propose a novel Metadata Indexing and Querying for Self-describing formats (MIQS), which removes the external DBMS and utilizes in-memory index to achieve efficient metadata searching. MIQS follows the self-contained data management paradigm and provides portable and schema-free metadata indexing and querying functionalities for self-describing file formats. We have evaluated MIQS with the state-of-the-art MongoDB-based metadata indexing solution. MIQS achieved up to 99% time reduction in index construction and up to 172,000X search performance improvement with up to 75% reduction in memory footprint.},
