  abstract={Scientific experiments and observations store massive amounts of data in various scientific file formats. Among these file formats, self-describing formats allow storing metadata to describe data objects. As a result, self-describing file formats are commonly used by scientists for sifting through the massive data and locating the data of interest...}
