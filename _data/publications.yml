    abstract: "With the advent of \u201Csocial sensing\u201D in the Big Data era,\
      \ location-based social media (LBSM) data are increasingly used to explore anthropogenic\
      \ activities and their impacts on the environment. This study converts a typical\
      \ kind of LBSM data, geo-tagged tweets, into raster images at the 500\u202F\
      m spatial resolution and compares them with the new generation nighttime lights\
      \ (NTL) image products, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)\
      \ Day/Night Band (DNB) monthly image composites. The results show that the monthly\
      \ tweet images are significantly correlated with the VIIRS-DNB images at the\
      \ pixel level. The tweet images have nearly the same ability on estimating electric\
      \ power consumption and better performance on assessing personal incomes and\
      \ population than the NTL images. Tweeted areas (i.e. the pixels with at least\
      \ one posted tweet) are closer to satellite-derived built-up/urban areas than\
      \ lit areas in NTL imagery, making tweet images an alternative to delimit extents\
      \ of human activities. Moreover, the monthly tweet images do not show apparent\
      \ seasonal changes, and the values of tweet images are more stable across different\
      \ months than VIIRS-DNB monthly image composites. This study explores the potential\
      \ of LBSM data at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolutions to estimate or\
      \ map socioeconomic factors as an alternative to NTL images in the United States."

    abstract: "High-performance computing (HPC) systems generate huge amounts of metadata\
      \ about different entities such as jobs, users, and files. Existing systems\
      \ can efficiently record and manage part of these metadata, mainly the POSIX\
      \ metadata of data files (e.g., file size, name, and permissions mode). But\
      \ another important set of metadata, referred to as \u201Crich\u201D metadata\
      \ in this study, which record not only wider range of entities (e.g., running\
      \ processes and jobs) but also more complex relationships between them, are\
      \ mostly missing in current HPC systems. Yet such rich metadata are critical\
      \ for supporting many advanced data management functions such as identifying\
      \ data sources and parameters behind a given result; auditing data usage; or\
      \ understanding details about how inputs are transformed into outputs. To uniformly\
      \ and efficiently manage the rich metadata generated in HPC systems, We propose\
      \ to utilize a graph model in this study. We identify the key challenges of\
      \ implementing such a graph-based HPC rich metadata management system and present\
      \ GraphMeta, a graph-based rich metadata management system designed and optimized\
      \ for HPC platforms, to tackle these challenges. Extensive evaluations on both\

      \ and scalability compared with existing solutions."

    abstract: "Location-based social media have been extensively utilized in the concept\

    abstract: "Nighttime lights (NTL) imagery is one of the most commonly used tools\
      \ to quantitatively study socioeconomic systems over large areas. In this study\
      \ we aim to use location-based social media big data to challenge the primacy\
      \ of NTL imagery on estimating socioeconomic factors. Geo-tagged tweets posted\
      \ in the contiguous United States in 2013 were retrieved to produce a tweet\
      \ image with the same spatial resolution of the NTL imagery (i.e., 0.00833\xB0\
      \u202F\xD7\u202F0.00833\xB0). Sum tweet (the total number of tweets) and sum\
      \ light (summed DN value of the NTL image) of each state or county were obtained\
      \ from the tweets and the NTL images, respectively, to estimate three important\
      \ socioeconomic factors: personal income, electric power consumption, and fossil\
      \ fuel carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that sum tweet is a better measure\
      \ of personal income and electric power consumption while carbon dioxide emissions\
      \ can be more accurately estimated by sum light. We further exploited that African-Americans\
      \ adults are more likely than White seniors to post geotagged tweets in the\
      \ US, yet did not find any significant correlations between proportions of the\
      \ subpopulations and the estimation accuracy of the socioeconomic factors. Existence\
      \ of saturated pixels and blooming effects and failure to remove gas flaring\
      \ reduce quality of NTL imagery in estimating socioeconomic factors, however,\
      \ such problems are nonexistent in the tweet images. This study reveals that\
      \ the number of geo-tagged tweets has great potential to be deemed as a substitute\
      \ of brightness of NTL to assess socioeconomic factors over large geographic\
      \ areas."

    abstract: Distributed representation methods for words have been developed for
      years, and numerous methods exist, such as word2vec, GloVe, and fastText. However,
      they are not designed for key-value pairs, which is an important data pattern
      and widely used in many scenarios. For example, metadata attributes of scientific
      files consist of a collection of key-value pairs. In this research, we propose
      kv2vec, a method that captures relationships between keys and values and represents
      key-value pairs in dense vectors. The fundamental idea of the kv2vec method
      is utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM)
      hidden units to convert each key-value pair to a distributed vector representation.
      This new method overcomes the weaknesses of existing embedding models for representing
      key-value pairs as vectors. Moreover, it can be integrated into dataset search
      solutions through querying metadata attributes for self-describing file formats
      that are widely used in HPC systems. We evaluate the kv2vec method with multiple
      real-world datasets, and the results show that kv2vec outperforms existing models.

    abstract: HPC systems typically rely on the fixed-lifetime (FLT) data retention
      strategy, which only considers temporal locality of data accesses to parallel
      file systems. However, our extensive analysis based on the leadership-class
      HPC system traces suggests that the FLT approach often fails to capture the
      dynamics in users' behavior and leads to undesired data purge. In this study,
      we propose an activeness-based data retention (ActiveDR) solution, which advocates
      considering the data retention approach from a holistic activeness-based perspective.
      By evaluating the frequency and impact of users' activities, ActiveDR prioritizes
      the file purge process for inactive users and rewards active users with extended
      file lifetime on parallel storage. Our extensive evaluations based on the traces
      of the prior Titan supercomputer show that, when reaching the same purge target,
      ActiveDR achieves up to 37% file miss reduction as compared to the current FLT
      retention methodology.

    abstract: Scientific experiments and observations store massive amounts of data
      in various scientific file formats. Metadata, which describes the characteristics
      of the data, is commonly used to sift through massive datasets in order to locate
      data of interest to scientists. Several indexing data structures (such as hash
      tables, trie, self-balancing search trees, sparse array, etc.) have been developed
      as part of efforts to provide an efficient method for locating target data.
      However, efficient determination of an indexing data structure remains unclear
      in the context of scientific data management, due to the lack of investigation
      on metadata, metadata queries, and corresponding data structures. In this study,
      we perform a systematic study of the metadata search essentials in the context
      of scientific data management. We study a real-world astronomy observation dataset
      and explore the characteristics of the metadata in the dataset. We also study
      possible metadata queries based on the discovery of the metadata characteristics
      and evaluate different data structures for various types of metadata attributes.
      Our evaluation on real-world dataset suggests that trie is a suitable data structure
      when prefix/suffix query is required, otherwise hash table should be used. We
      conclude our study with a summary of our findings. These findings provide a
      guideline and offers insights in developing metadata indexing methodologies
      for scientific applications.

    abstract: Scientific applications often store datasets in self-describing data
      file formats, such as HDF5 and netCDF. Regrettably, to efficiently search the
      metadata within these files remains challenging due to the sheer size of the
      datasets. Existing solutions extract the metadata and store it in external database
      management systems (DBMS) to locate desired data. However, this practice introduces
      significant overhead and complexity in extraction and querying. In this research,
      we propose a novel <u>M</u>etadata <u>I</u>ndexing and <u>Q</u>uerying <u>S</u>ervice
      (MIQS), which removes the external DBMS and utilizes in-memory index to achieve
      efficient metadata searching. MIQS follows the self-contained data management
      paradigm and provides portable and schema-free metadata indexing and querying
      functionalities for self-describing file formats. We have evaluated MIQS with
      the state-of-the-art MongoDB-based metadata indexing solution. MIQS achieved
      up to 99% time reduction in index construction and up to 172kx search performance
      improvement with up to 75% reduction in memory footprint.

    abstract: Affix-based search is a fundamental functionality for storage systems.
      It allows users to find desired datasets, where attributes of a dataset match
      an affix. While building inverted index to facilitate efficient affix-based
      keyword search is a common practice for standalone databases and for desktop
      file systems, building local indexes or adopting indexing techniques used in
      a standalone data store is insufficient for high-performance computing (HPC)
      systems due to the massive amount of data and distributed nature of the storage
      devices within a system. In this paper, we propose Distributed Adaptive Radix
      Tree (DART), to address the challenge of distributed affix-based keyword search
      on HPC systems. This trie-based approach is scalable in achieving efficient
      affix-based search and alleviating imbalanced keyword distribution and excessive
      requests on keywords at scale. Our evaluation at different scales shows that,
      comparing with the "full string hashing" use case of the most popular distributed
      indexing technique - Distributed Hash Table (DHT), DART achieves up to 55\texttimes{}
      better throughput with prefix search and with suffix search, while achieving
      comparable throughput with exact and infix searches. Also, comparing to the
      "initial hashing" use case of DHT, DART maintains a balanced keyword distribution
      on distributed nodes and alleviates excessive query workload against popular
      keywords.

    abstract: Many graph-related applications face the challenge of managing excessive
      and ever-growing graph data in a distributed environment. Therefore, it is necessary
      to consider a graph partitioning algorithm to distribute graph data onto multiple
      machines as the data comes in. Balancing data distribution and minimizing edge-cut
      ratio are two basic pursuits of the graph partitioning problem. While achieving
      balanced partitions for streaming graphs is easy, existing graph partitioning
      algorithms either fail to work on streaming workloads, or leave edge-cut ratio
      to be further improved. Our research aims to provide a better solution that
      fits the need of streaming graph partitioning in a distributed system, which
      further reduces the edge-cut ratio while maintaining rough balance among all
      partitions. We exploit the similarity measure on the degree of vertices to gather
      structuralrelated vertices in the same partition as much as possible, this reduces
      the edge-cut ratio even further as compared to the state-of-the-art streaming
      graph partitioning algorithm - FENNEL. Our evaluation shows that our streaming
      graph partitioning algorithm is able to achieve better partitioning quality
      in terms of edge-cut ratio (up to 20% reduction as compared to FENNEL) while
      maintaining decent balance between all partitions, and such improvement applies
      to various real-life graphs.

    abstract: Graphs have become increasingly important in many applications and domains
      such as querying relationships in social networks or managing rich metadata
      generated in scientific computing. Many of these use cases require high-performance
      distributed graph databases for serving continuous updates from clients and,
      at the same time, answering complex queries regarding the current graph. These
      operations in graph databases, also referred to as online transaction processing
      (OLTP) operations, have specific design and implementation requirements for
      graph partitioning algorithms. In this research, we argue it is necessary to
      consider the connectivity and the vertex degree changes during graph partitioning.
      Based on this idea, we designed an Incremental Online Graph Partitioning (IOGP)
      algorithm that responds accordingly to the incremental changes of vertex degree.
      IOGP helps achieve better locality, generate balanced partitions, and increase
      the parallelism for accessing high-degree vertices of the graph. Over both real-world
      and synthetic graphs, IOGP demonstrates as much as 2x better query performance
      with a less than 10% overhead when compared against state-of-the-art graph partitioning
      algorithms.

    abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) systems face increasingly critical
      metadata management challenges, especially in the approaching exascale era.
      These challenges arise not only from exploding metadata volumes but also from
      increasingly diverse metadata, which contains data provenance and user-defined
      attributes in addition to traditional POSIX metadata. This "rich" metadata is
      critical to support many advanced data management functionality such as data
      auditing and validation. In our prior work, we presented a graph-based model
      that could be a promising solution to uniformly manage such rich metadata because
      of its flexibility and generality. At the same time, however, graph-based rich
      metadata management introduces significant challenges. In this study, we first
      identify the challenges presented by the underlying infrastructure in supporting
      scalable, high-performance rich metadata management. To tackle these challenges,
      we then present GraphMeta, a graph-based engine designed for managing large-scale
      rich metadata. We also utilize a series of optimizations designed for rich metadata
      graphs. We evaluate GraphMeta with both synthetic and real HPC metadata workloads
      and compare it with other approaches. The results show that its advantages in
      terms of rich metadata management in HPC systems, including better performance
      and scalability compared with existing solutions.

    abstract: In this research, we propose a novel Metadata Indexing and Querying
      for Self-describing formats (MIQS), which removes the external DBMS and utilizes
      in-memory index to achieve efficient metadata searching. MIQS follows the self-contained
      data management paradigm and provides portable and schema-free metadata indexing
      and querying functionalities for self-describing file formats. We have evaluated
      MIQS with the state-of-the-art MongoDB-based metadata indexing solution. MIQS
      achieved up to 99% time reduction in index construction and up to 172,000X search
      performance improvement with up to 75% reduction in memory footprint.

    abstract: Scientific experiments and observations store massive amounts of data
      in various scientific file formats. Among these file formats, self-describing
      formats allow storing metadata to describe data objects. As a result, self-describing
      file formats are commonly used by scientists for sifting through the massive
      data and locating the data of interest...
